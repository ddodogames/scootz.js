# 1.0.1 Build 1701
* Fixed a bug that was using the wrong parameter name in `$isBoostMessage`
* Added `$owoify`
  * Usage: `$owoify[text]`

# 1.0.0
Nothing much has changed besides few changes such as new usage for existing functions from the original package and a new function called `$welcomeMessage` intended to be used for `onJoin` event from aoi.js

Node.js 20 or later is now required to be able to use the package as well!
